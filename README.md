# 🚀 ResNet vs. CNN on FashionMNIST  

This project is my **first paper implementation** 🎉, where I built and compared a **ResNet** model and a **standard CNN** from scratch, training both on the **FashionMNIST** dataset. The goal is to analyze their performance in terms of accuracy, training time, and generalization.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ ResNet and CNN implementation from scratch  
✅ Training and evaluation on FashionMNIST  
✅ Performance comparison with accuracy metrics  
✅ Dataset preprocessing and augmentation  
✅ Built using **PyTorch**  

## 📊 Results  
| Model  | Accuracy |
|--------|----------|
| CNN    | 89.61%      |
| ResNet | 89.35%      |

📌 Dataset

We use FashionMNIST, a dataset of grayscale images of clothing items. It consists of:

    60,000 training images

    10,000 test images

    10 classes (T-shirts, Shoes, Bags, etc.)
Let me know if you want to tweak anything! 😃
