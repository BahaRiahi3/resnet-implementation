# ðŸš€ ResNet vs. CNN on FashionMNIST  

This project is my **first paper implementation** ðŸŽ‰, where I built and compared a **ResNet** model and a **standard CNN** from scratch, training both on the **FashionMNIST** dataset. The goal is to analyze their performance in terms of accuracy, training time, and generalization.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
âœ… ResNet and CNN implementation from scratch  
âœ… Training and evaluation on FashionMNIST  
âœ… Performance comparison with accuracy metrics  
âœ… Dataset preprocessing and augmentation  
âœ… Built using **PyTorch**  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
| Model  | Accuracy |
|--------|----------|
| CNN    | 89.61%      |
| ResNet | 89.35%      |

ðŸ“Œ Dataset

We use FashionMNIST, a dataset of grayscale images of clothing items. It consists of:

- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
- 10 classes (T-shirts, Shoes, Bags, etc.)
